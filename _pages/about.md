I'm currently (Apr. 2024) a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at the Computer and Information Sciences Department at Temple University, advised by [Dr. Yu Wang](https://cis.temple.edu/~yu/). I'm interested in research on networking and networked systems, such as networks for AI and quantum networks. I have worked at Toyota Motor North America as a machine learning research intern during Aug. 23 - Dec. 23, supervised by Dr. Yongkang Liu.

Prior to this, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Information Security from North China University of Technology in 2020.
